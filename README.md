# Chordify: AI-Powered Music Learning & Management Platform

## Overview
Chordify is a **centralized platform** designed to streamline the experience of **music tutors and students**. The system leverages **AI-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, **automated scheduling**, **progress tracking**, and **payment management** to enhance music education.

## Problem Statement
Many **music tutors and students** struggle with:
1. **Time-consuming administrative tasks** â€“ managing lessons, schedules, and payments.
2. **Unpredictable schedules** â€“ difficulty in rescheduling and availability tracking.
3. **Payment hassles** â€“ ensuring timely payments and tracking financials.
4. **Lack of student progress tracking** â€“ missing structured feedback loops.

Chordify **solves these issues** by offering an AI-driven platform that integrates all aspects of **lesson management, scheduling, payments, and student progress tracking**.

## Project Structure
This repository includes the following key components:

### 1. **Chordify_RAG_v2.ipynb** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation & Fine-Tuning)
- Loads a **pretrained AI model** for structured lesson retrieval.
- Fine-tunes **RAG** to improve music lesson recommendations.
- Evaluates model performance with **NDCG, MRR, and MAP metrics**.

### 2. **Chordify_DataSimulation.ipynb** (Data Simulation & Augmentation)
- Simulates a dataset of **10,000 users** with **tutor-student interactions**.
- Generates **lesson schedules, payments, reviews, and progress tracking data**.
- Structures data to **train and enhance AI-driven personalization**.

## Key Features
âœ… **AI-Powered Tutor-Student Matching** â€“ Helps students find the right tutor based on their goals.
âœ… **Automated Scheduling & Availability Tracking** â€“ Reduces cancellations and scheduling conflicts.
âœ… **Integrated Payment System** â€“ Manages transactions seamlessly between students and tutors.
âœ… **Progress Tracking & Lesson Analytics** â€“ Tutors can assess student improvements and adjust teaching methods.
âœ… **Personalized Recommendations** â€“ AI-driven lesson suggestions based on student learning patterns.
âœ… **Performance Monitoring** â€“ Uses NDCG@10, MRR@10, and MAP@100 for evaluating retrieval accuracy.

## Installation & Dependencies
To set up and run the platform:

```sh
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers datasets numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/arjunghosh4/chordify-ai.git
   cd chordify-ai
   ```
2. **Run the Data Simulation Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Chordify_DataSimulation.ipynb
   ```
   - This generates **lesson schedules, payments, and tutor-student interactions**.
3. **Run the AI Fine-Tuning Notebook:**
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Chordify_RAG_v2.ipynb
   ```
   - Fine-tunes **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models** for personalized lesson recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** â€“ Secure tutor and student access management.
- **Student Engagement Prediction** â€“ AI detects potential dropouts and recommends interventions.
- **Automated Marketing Suggestions** â€“ AI-driven ads based on student demand trends.

## Security Considerations
- **Prevention of SQL Injection Attacks** â€“ Secure database queries.
- **Compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA** â€“ Ensuring regulatory standards.

## Business Impact
ðŸ“ˆ **Freelance Boom** â€“ 36% of U.S. workers freelance, many in **music education**.
ðŸŽµ **Music EdTech Growth** â€“ Expected to grow **from $17B in 2024 to $73.27B by 2033**.
ðŸ’¡ **AI-Enhanced Learning** â€“ Chordify provides a structured, efficient solution for tutors and students.
